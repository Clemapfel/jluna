# jluna: A modern Julia Wrapper for C++ (v1.0.0)


![](./header.png)

Julia is a beautiful language, it is well-designed, and well-documented. Julia's C-API is also well-designed, less beautiful, and much less... documented.<br>
jluna aims to fully wrap the official Julia C-API, replacing it in projects with C++ as the host language, by making accessing Julia's unique strengths through C++ safe, hassle-free, and just as beautiful.

### Features

+ expressive, generic syntax
+ create / call / assign Julia-side variables from C++
+ full exception forwarding, verbose error messages with complete stacktrace
+ `std` types & usertypes can be moved freely between Julia and C++
+ call arbitrary C++ functions from Julia
+ multidimensional, iterable array interface
+ provides a custom thread pool that, [unlike the C-API](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/multi_threading.html), allows for concurrent interfacing with Julia
+ provides < 5% overhead functions, viable in performance-critical environments
+ complete [manual](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/basics.html), [installation guide](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/installation.md), [benchmark analysis](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/benchmarks.html), inline documentation for IDEs - all written by a human
+ and more!

### Showcase

(If you are looking for examples showing best-practice basic usage, please instead consult the [manual](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/basics.html))

#### Executing Julia Code

```cpp
 // execute multi-line Julia code
Main.safe_eval(R"(
     f(x) = x^x^x
     vec = Int64[1, 2, 3, 4]
 )");

// call Julia functions with C++ values
auto f = Main["f"];
std::cout << (Int64) f(3) << std::endl;

// mutate Julia-side values
Main["vec"][2] = 999;
Main.safe_eval("println(vec)");

// assign `std` objects to Julia variables
Main["vec"] = std::vector<char>{117, 118, 119, 120};
Main.safe_eval("println(vec)");
```
```
2030534587
[1, 2, 999, 4]
['u', 'v', 'w', 'x']
```

---

#### Array Interface

```cpp
// array interface
Array<Int64, 2> matrix = Main.safe_eval("return reshape([i for i in 1:(4*4)], 4, 4)");

// supports multi-dimensional indexing (and array comprehension, not shown here)
matrix.at(0, 2) = 999;
Main["println"](matrix);

// even has generator expressions!
auto generated_vector = Vector<char>("(Char(i) for i in 97:104)"_gen);
Main["println"](generated_vector);
```
```
[1 5 9 13; 2 6 10 14; 999 7 11 15; 4 8 12 16]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
```

---

#### Calling C++ Functions from Julia
```cpp
Main.safe_eval("cpp_function = () -> ()"); // forward declaration

// assign C++ lambda to Julia Function
Main["cpp_function"] = as_julia_function<void(std::string)>(
    [](std::string in) -> void {
        std::cout << "cpp prints: " << in << std::endl;
    }
);

// call lambda, entirely Julia-side
Main.safe_eval(R"(
  cpp_function("what_julia_hands_it")
)");
```
```
cpp prints: what_julia_hands_it
```

## Dependencies

jluna aims to be as modern as is practical. It uses C++20 features extensively and aims to support the newest Julia version, rather than focusing on backwards compatibility.

For jluna you'll need:
+ [**Julia 1.7.0**](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) (or newer)
+ [**cmake 3.12**](https://cmake.org/download/) (or newer)
+ C++ Compiler, one of
    - [g++10](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (or newer)<br>
    - [clang++-12](https://releases.llvm.org/) (or newer)<br>
    - [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) 19.34 (or newer)

On Unix, g++ or clang (installed using your package manager) are recommended. <br>
On Windows, either use g++ provided by [MinGW](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) or MSVC provided by the [Visual Studio C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

In either case, make sure the compilers' version is as stated above, as jluna uses modern C++20 features extensively.

## [Installation & Troubleshooting](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/installation.html)

> A step-by-step guide is available [here](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/installation.html). It is recommended that you follow this guide, instead of the highly abridged version below.

> **For IDEs**: In many cases, simply opening the cloned jluna project in an IDE (such as VisualStudio, Atom, or CLion) will allow it to automatically set everything up for you. After initialization, simply run "install" from your build menu.

### Command Line

Execute, in your bash console, in any public directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna
cd jluna
mkdir build
cd build
```
```
cmake .. -DJULIA_BINDIR=$(julia -e "println(Sys.BINDIR)") -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<C++ Compiler> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install directory>
```
Where
+ `<C++ Compiler>` is the C++ compiler executable, e.g. `g++`, `clang++`, `cl.exe`, etc.
+ `<install directory>` is the desired install directory, omit this option to use the systems default directory

Then:
```
make install
ctest --verbose
```

Which will deposit the library to the specified system folder and run tests to make sure everything works.

#### Example Usage

For example, installing on a linux machine using g++:

```
git clone https://github.com/Clemapfel/jluna
cd jluna
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DJULIA_BINDIR=$(julia -e "println(Sys.BINDIR)") -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/g++
sudo make install
ctest --verbose
```
Where ommitting `DCMAKE_INSTALL_PATH` makes CMake choose the default system path. `sudo` was necessary to write to that path.

---

Afterward, you can make jluna available to your library using

```cmake
# inside your own CMakeLists.txt
find_library(jluna REQUIRED 
    NAMES jluna
    PATHS <install directory>
)
target_link_libraries(<your library> PRIVATE
    "${jluna}" 
    "${<julia>}")
```
Where
+ `<install directory>` is the directory specified via `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`
+ `<julia>` is the Julia shared library (usually available in `"${JULIA_BINDIR}/../lib"`)
+ `<your library>` is the name of your library or executable

If any step of this does not work for you, please follow the [installation guide](https://clemens-cords.com/jluna/installation.html) instead.
